# Realistic Handcuffs FiveM
A cuff script that adds more realistic handcuffed behaviour.

Note: I've made this resource a long time ago but never released it until now.
It should still work but I haven't tested it 100% with the latest version.

It doesn't have a lot of features but there are some small improvements that make the cuffs actually more realistic. Like no weapons while being cuffed, you can't climb a wall when cuffed, you can't start a stopped vehicle or steer it left/right. If the engine is already running you can only go forward/backwards in a straight line! If you're using the MP male/female ped, you actually get the handcuff props added to your wrists, they get automatically removed when you are uncuffed.

I won't provide support for this resource as it's and old script.
And beside that, there's a million other cuff scripts released by now so just use another script if this is broken.
